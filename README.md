# Embedded Systems Cloud IDE

This repository hosts a cloud-based integrated development environment for the development of embedded systems software. The entire tool-chain is hosted in the cloud and provides a fast an easy way of coding in the C programming language. The IDE is targeting embedded systems but can also be used for general-purpose system programming among Linux or even teaching Linux basics via the integrated terminal. The benefit is that also low-level flashing and debugging of hardware is supported by any device capable of running a modern web browser, without the setup and configuration hassles of bloated proprietary vendor specific IDEs. Furthermore it provides a consistent UI across all operating systems.

All the development tools (compiler, version management, debugger) are hosted on a cloud server and allow building of software for target devices. The hardware needs to be available on the target-side that is either "in the cloud" or connected to the client. On the target-side only a minimal set of tools is mandatory to enable interfacing between the target hardware and the development tools on the server. On the client-side a standard web browser suffices.

### HaaS

One way to set up the IDE is to provide the development platform as a service in a cloud environment. In this case the user just logs into the IDE with the help of a modern web-browser and can program the development board connected to the server hosting the IDE instance. The OCDS software as well as the debug-control service used for interacting with the hardware are both set up automatically within the corresponding docker container. In our setup the development platform is tied directly to the IDE instance based on the serial number of the hardware. The WebSocket address specified in the cloud IDE has to be set to the address of the server. For every project these addresses can be set in the appropriate [configuration file](cloud9workspace/README.md) or from the UI if the "NOOB" mode is not explicitly enabled.

### Universal

The second way the cloud IDE can be set up is in universal mode. As the name suggests, in this setup, the target platform is connected to any computational device located anywhere on the Internet or local network infrastructure with access to the server. In comparison to the HaaS setup, the universal setup requires the OCDS software and the debug-control service to be running on the computational device the hardware is connected. The WebSocket address specified in the cloud IDE has to be set to "Local" when the cloud IDE is used on the same device the debug-control service is running. If the hardware and debug-control service are located somewhere different from the web-browser used for programing, the WebSocket address has to match the address of the device the debug-control service is running. 

## Requirements

### Operating System:

  * Server setup (Tested on Debian-based systems: Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
  * Debug-Control Service (Independent)
  * Valid [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates at `/etc/letsencrypt` to be mounted by each docker container with, e.g., [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)
    
        sudo apt-get install certbot [-t jessie-backports]
        certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com

  * Regularly update the certificates with a Cron job issued by root:

        sudo crontab -e
        0 0 */31 * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --post-hook "docker restart $(docker ps -a -q)" > /var/log/certbot/certbot.log 2>&1 

### Build Tools ([Debug-Control Service](software/README.md)):

  * Ant
    * On Mac OS X install via Homebrew (Requires XCode & Command Line Tools)
  * JDK `>= 1.8` (Add to `JAVA_HOME` path)
    * Recommended: Oracle JDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) as long as JavaFX is not distributed with OpenJDK
  * Monocle (Headless mode for HaaS setup)
    * The headless mode implementation for JavaFX is not included in the current JDK releases and has therefore to be added manually
    * Copy `software/OpenJFX_Monocle/openjfx-monocle-8uXX-XXX.jar` to `JDK/jre/lib/ext/` directory
    * The sources for building Monocle libraries reside in `software/OpenJFX_Monocle/Monocle/`
  * Debian packaging tools `build-essential` (DEB)

### Embedded Tools:

  * Depending on the target platform, respective On-Chip Debug System software (OpenOCD, JLink GDB Server) is required. While a
    patched version of OpenOCD for the "TI TM4C1294XL" is distributed with this repository (64-Bit deb & rpm packages), other options have to be built from source. 
    In this case follow the README in the OCDS_Software/openocd-VERSION directory. Replace the "make install" command with "checkinstall" if you want to create a package 
    instead of directly copying the files into the system folders for easier removal.
  * JLink GDB Server can be downloaded from https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html 
  * For HaaS setups place the 64-Bit DEB installer in the "OCDS_Software" folder.

### Additional components for Docker setup:

  * docker
  * python, python-pip & wget module (pip install wget)
  * usbutils (Linux)

### Supported development platforms:

  * Infineon XMC4500 Relax/Relax Lite Kit
  * TI Tiva C Series TM4C1294 Connected LaunchPad

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository recursively:
    
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/jhausladen/esclide.git

The automatic install-script will use Docker for creating independent containers (recommended). Simply run:

    python docker_container.py -n <Name> -w <Workstationname> -u <Username> -k <Password> -p <IDE Port> -t <HTTP-Download Port> [Optional: -c <Setup Configuration> -d <Debug Port> -e <Websocket Port> -m <Target> -s <Serial> -r <Projects> -j <ON/JLink Port> -o <ON/OOCD Port> -b <Enable NOOB Mode>]

The following options are given:

    -n/--name                 Name of docker container
    -w/--workstationname      Name of the workstation hosting the service 
    -u/--user                 Username for the created workspace
    -k/--password             Password for the created workspace
    -s/--serial               Serial number of hardware connected to container
    -p/--port                 Cloud IDE port (default: 3131/[configs/supervisor_config/cloud9.conf])

    -e/--websocket            WebSocket port for the client-side connection to the target-side (default: 8080/[configs/wsport.conf])
    -m/--target               Target platform (XMC4500/TM4C1294XL)
    -r/--projects             Specifies projects that are copied to the workspace during setup (projects must reside within the build context of the dockerfile)
    -j/--jlinkport            Enable JLink/Custom JLink GDB server port (default: 2331/[configs/supervisor_config/debugcontrolservice.conf])
    -o/--oocdport             Enable OpenOCD/Custom OpenOCD port (default: 3333/[configs/supervisor_config/debugcontrolservice.conf])
    -b/--noob                 Enable NOOB Mode (default: 0/[configs/noob.conf])
    -h/--help                 Show command line options (optional)

For building, installation an usage of the debug-control service outside of the HaaS setup (needed for the second example) please refer to the [Debug-Control Service README.](software/README.md)

## Example Setup

One can easily setup the cloud IDE with the help of configuration files:

    python docker_container.py -c <Setup Configuration>

In case of a HaaS setup the development platform is connected to the server and the debug-control service will be ran directly within the docker container beside the cloud IDE. The following command sets up a HaaS setup for the XMC4500:

    python docker_container.py -n <Name> -w <Workstationname> -u <Username> -k <Password> -p <IDE Port> -t <HTTP-Download Port> -e <Websocket Port> -s <Serial> -j ON -m XMC4500

If the debug-control service is supposed to run on any suitable computational device with a connected development board, a simple setup would look like this:

    python docker_container.py -n <Name> -w <Workstationname> -u <Username> -k <Password> -p <IDE Port> -d <Debug Port> -t <HTTP-Download Port>

This setup also requires the corresponding OCDS software to be installed on the host running the Debug-Control Service and a suitable development-platform attached.

WARNING: If the JLink Port & OOCD Port are not turned off, the debug-control service within the container could establish a connection to the cloud IDE before the local debug-control service that is used for debugging the local hardware!
