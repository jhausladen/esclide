== Login

. Start a WEB browser and point it to the `cloud-emb.technikum-wien.at:YourPort`
URL. `YourPort` is specific as well as the login data. [red]#Ask your instructor
in order to obtain access to this cloud service.#
+
TIP: Supported browsers are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Opera.

[NOTE]
======
Both indicators in the top right corner of the cloud IDE should turn green.

. Now using drag and drop - grab a project in your file explorer (e.g.
link:https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5eRiAuqb80jcnRQdGpYOFVmdkk[TI_TM4C1294XL.tar.gz]) and drop it onto the top most
symbol in under `WORKSPACE FILES` - in this way the compressed archive is added
to your workspace. Next, right click the compressed archive and select
`Extract`. Then expand the folder `src` and click on `main.c` to open up the
top-level source file.

. Open another tab in the browser and navigate to `cloud-emb.technikum-wien.at:5000` to view your development board.

== Flashing

When flashing a program onto the development platform open up the main "C" file
of the project you wish to flash and select `Flash` from the `Embedded
Developer` menu.

This invokes the build process and flashes the resulting image onto the target
platform. The results of the flash procedure are shown in the console tab of the
IDE.

[NOTE]
If the results show [green]`Flashing succeeded` the flash process was successful.

== Debugging

For Debugging a program open up the main "C" file of the project you wish to
debug and select `Debug` from the `Embedded Developer` menu. This will invoke
the build process and take the Cloud IDE into debug mode.

The debug panel on the right side is used to control the debug process (step,
run, stop), add variables for inspection and breakpoints. Variables can be added
by typing their name in the textentry box above the watch variable listing and
pressing the `Enter` key. Variables can be remove by selecting the appropriate
item and pressing the `Delete` key. Breakpoints can be added/removed by clicking
on the desired line number in the editor.

== FAQ

Q: I cannot flash/debug my program because the appropriate entries in the
`Embedded Developer` menu are disabled.

A: Check the `Debug-Control Service` indicator in the cloud IDE. If the
indicator is red, this means that the connection between the browser and the
software is not established. Check the selected location in the `Target-Side`
menu so that it's set to the location your embedded board is connected, e.g., `cloud-emb.technikum-wien.at`. 

Q: I have set breakpoints but they are ignored when debugging.

A: Check if the breakpoints exist and are enabled in the breakpoint tab of the
debug panel. A breakpoint which is ticked is enabled whilst a breakpoint without
a tick is disabled.

Q: When I switch to another project, my breakpoints and variables disappear.

A: This is because breakpoints and inspected variables are saved separately for each project.
